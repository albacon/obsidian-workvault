## Cervical Artery Dysfunction (CAD)

A range of vascular problems in the neck that can affect blood flow to the brain and potentially lead to serious complications like stroke.

This is an **umbrella term** that includes:

- **Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency (VBI)**
    
- **Vertebral Artery Dissection**
    
- **Carotid Artery Pathologies**

	The R+L Anterior Cerebral Arteries are connected by the Anterior Communicating Artery and the Middle and Posterior Cerebral Arteries by the Posterior Communicating Artery - forming the Circle of Willis

A potential red flag pathology because if left untreated it could cause an interruption in blood flow of the:

- ## Posterior Circulation (20%) - Vertebral Arteries (R+L) -> Basilar Artery -> Posterior Cerebral Arteries (R+L)

	- supplies the brainstem, cerebellum, occipital lobes and part of the thalamus

	- #### üîë **Classic Posterior Circulation Red Flags**
		- **Vertigo/dizziness** (especially if not positional)
		- **Gait instability, ataxia**
		- **Diplopia** (double vision)
		- **Dysarthria** (slurred speech)
		- **Dysphagia** (difficulty swallowing)
		- **Drop attacks** (sudden falls without LOC)
		- **Nystagmus**
		- **Numbness/tingling in face or limbs**
		- **Clumsiness or hand incoordination**
		
		i.e. 5Ds, 3Ns, UL/LL neurology
		
		These are often sudden in onset and may be **position-dependent** (e.g., worsened by head/neck movement).

- ## Anterior Circulation (80%) - Internal Carotid Arteries -> Divides into Anterior and Middle Cerebral Arteries (!MCA)
	- Supplies the Frontal Lobes, Parietal Lobes, Temporal Lobes (partly), Basal Ganglia, Internal Capsule

	- ### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Classic Anterior Circulation Red Flags**
	
		- **Unilateral weakness or numbness**
		    - Especially face and upper limb (MCA territory)
		- **Speech disturbances**
			- Broca‚Äôs (expressive) or Wernicke‚Äôs (receptive) aphasia
		- **Visual changes**
		    - Blurred vision, field loss (e.g. same-sided loss in both eyes)
		- **Personality or behaviour changes** (frontal lobe)
		- **Neglect or inattention to one side** (especially with right parietal damage)
	
		i.e. 5Ds, 3Ns, UL/LL Neurology

- ## **Previous** biggest concerns (types of Cervical Artery Dysfunction, reasons for disrupted flow):


- ### Vertebro-Basilar Insufficiency (VBI)

	- #### üí° **What is it?**

		A **transient, reversible reduction in blood flow** to the brainstem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes due to:
		- Atherosclerosis (narrowing of arteries)
		- Poor vascular flow (especially with head positions)
		- Sometimes postural or movement-related compression (e.g. osteophytes, cervical extension/rotation)

	- #### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Typical Presentation**
		- Symptoms are often **positional** (worse with head turning or extension)
		- **Short-lived**, come and go
    
		- Examples:
		    - Dizziness or vertigo
		    - Drop attacks (sudden falls without LOC)
		    - Visual disturbances (blurred vision, diplopia)
		    - Slurred speech
		    - Unsteadiness

	- #### üìã **How it fits into CAD**
		- It‚Äôs more of a **functional blood flow problem**, often due to narrowing/positional effects.
		- Think of it as **chronic or mechanical** in nature.
		- **Not a true vascular injury**, but can precede more serious events.
	
	**Urgency and risk:** stroke possible over time, to monitor and refer if persistent

- ### Vertebral Artery Dissection (VAD)

	- ### üí° **What is it?**

		A **tear in the inner lining** (intima) of the vertebral artery, allowing blood to enter the arterial wall, creating a **false lumen** and potentially leading to:
		- Ischaemia (stroke)
		- Thrombus formation and embolism

	- ### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Typical Presentation**
		- Often **sudden onset**, severe symptoms
		- Can be **spontaneous** (especially in younger people) or follow minor trauma (e.g. rapid neck movement, coughing, manipulation)
		
		- Examples:
		    - **Unilateral neck pain or headache** (often occipital)
		    - Neurological symptoms (5 D‚Äôs and 3 N‚Äôs)
		    - Symptoms may be **non-positional** and **progressive**
		    - Sometimes delayed onset after trauma (e.g. days later)

	- ### üìã **How it fits into CAD**
		- It‚Äôs an **actual vascular injury**‚Äîhighly dangerous and a red flag for stroke.
		- Requires **urgent referral** (A&E or stroke team).
		- Not usually responsive to mechanical changes (i.e. not brought on or relieved by neck positions).
	**Urgency and risk:** High stroke risk, a medical emergency - for A&E referral


- ## How these pathologies may present as neck pain or headaches:
	![[Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 14.00.50.png|500]]
	The idea is to catch patients here

---

- ## What are some causes of disrupted blood flow of the arteries of the cervical spine that lead to CAD (VBI/VAD)?
	
	- Trauma
	- Atherosclerosis (narrowing due to plaque deposits)
	- Thrombosis (blood clot)
	- Embolism (blood clot breaks off a thrombus elsewhere and travels)
	
	Atherosclerosis/Thrombosis etc are not specific to the cervical spine but can present as neck pain or headaches


---

- ## What forms the Objective Assessment of these patients?
	![[Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 14.50.49.png]]
	?Combined extension/rotation, sustained EOR rotation increases symptoms

---
Neck pain and headaches could be **pre-ischaemic** event symptoms

An ischaemic event (loss of blood flow) would have more clear signs of neurology - 5D's 3Ns, neurology:

However VBI and VAD account for 0.00006% of cases in physio - so unlikely to identify these

- ## So how should our questions be focused?

	Therefore the focus is on identifying Cerebrovascular (CVA) and Cardiovascular (CVR) **risk factors** for pathologies in blood vessels of the Cervical Spine that present as neck pain and/or headaches but could cause a major neurological event (e.g a stroke, maybe as a result of CAD):

	![[Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 14.20.31.png]]
	
	Constant, non-mechanical, unremitting increases suspicion of CAD
	
	How do these risk factors increase risk?
	![[Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 14.28.44.png|700]]

- ## How do we manage these patients?
