## Structure

![[IMG_0170.jpeg]]

Tendons are tough, fibrous connective tissues that attach muscles to bones. They transmit the force generated by muscles to move the skeleton. Let’s break down their structure from the smallest unit to the whole tendon:

1. [[Collagen]] Fibrils:

• The basic building blocks of tendons.

• Made mostly of Type I collagen, which provides strength and resistance to stretching.

• These fibrils are bundled together to form larger structures.

2. Collagen Fibers:

• Groups of collagen fibrils form collagen fibers.

• These fibers are wavy (called crimped) when relaxed, allowing them to stretch when tension is applied.

3. Primary Fiber Bundles (Subfascicles):

• Multiple collagen fibers combine to form subfascicles.

• Surrounded by a thin layer of connective tissue called the endotenon, which contains small blood vessels and nerves.
  

4. Secondary Fiber Bundles (Fascicles):

• Several subfascicles group together to form a fascicle.

• The fascicles are still wrapped by endotenon, maintaining flexibility and allowing them to glide against each other.

5. Tertiary Fiber Bundles:

• Multiple fascicles combine to form tertiary bundles, adding further strength and structural integrity.

6. Whole Tendon:

• All tertiary bundles come together to form the whole tendon, which is surrounded by a protective outer layer called the epitenon.

• Some tendons have an additional outer covering called the paratenon, which reduces friction where the tendon glides over bones or other structures.

**Cellular Components**:

• Tendons contain tenocytes (specialized fibroblasts) that produce collagen and help maintain tendon health.

• Also contain proteoglycans and glycoproteins that help with water retention and load distribution.
### How do they do this?

Proteoglycans and glycoproteins within tendons play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the tissue, particularly when it comes to water retention and load distribution.

How They Work:

1. Water Retention:

• Proteoglycans, like decorin and aggrecan, consist of a core protein with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains (e.g., chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate). These GAG chains are highly negatively charged and attract water molecules, creating a hydrated gel-like matrix within the tendon.

• This water content contributes to the viscoelastic properties of the tendon, allowing it to deform under load and return to its original shape when the load is removed.

2. Load Distribution:

• The hydrated matrix formed by proteoglycans helps to dissipate compressive forces and shear stresses within the tendon. This is especially important in regions like the tendon-bone junction (enthesis) or areas exposed to compressive forces (e.g., where tendons wrap around bony prominences).

• Glycoproteins, such as tenascin-C and fibronectin, contribute to the structural network by linking collagen fibers and interacting with cells. This helps distribute tensile forces across the extracellular matrix (ECM), enhancing the tendon’s resilience to strain.

Clinical Relevance:

When tendon structure is compromised (like in tendinopathy), proteoglycan content can increase, leading to excessive water retention and altered load distribution. This contributes to swelling and reduced mechanical efficiency, making the tendon more prone to injury



## Function

Key Functions of Tendons:

1. Force Transmission:

• Tendons act as mechanical linkages between muscle and bone, transmitting the pulling force generated by muscle contraction to produce joint movement.

• They are highly efficient at transferring force due to their strong, collagen-rich structure, which aligns parallel to the direction of force.

2. Energy Storage and Return:

• Tendons, especially long and elastic ones like the Achilles tendon, store elastic potential energy when stretched during movement (like running or jumping).

• This energy is then released to aid propulsion, improving movement efficiency and reducing muscular effort.

3. Shock Absorption and Load Distribution:

• Tendons help dampen high-impact forces, protecting muscles and joints from sudden stress.

• Their viscoelastic properties allow them to absorb energy and distribute loads evenly, reducing the risk of injury.

4. Proprioception and Sensory Feedback:

• Tendons contain sensory receptors (like Golgi tendon organs) that detect changes in tension and provide feedback to the nervous system, helping regulate muscle force and prevent overstretching or injury.

Structural Features Enabling Function:

1. Collagen Fibers:

• Type I collagen fibers are tightly packed and aligned parallel to the tendon’s length, allowing them to withstand high tensile loads.

2. Proteoglycans and Glycoproteins:

• These components retain water, contributing to the tendon’s viscoelasticity and enabling it to handle both tensile and compressive forces.

3. Hierarchical Structure:

• Tendons are organized in a hierarchical fashion: collagen molecules → fibrils → fibers → fascicles → tendon. This structure enhances strength and load distribution.
