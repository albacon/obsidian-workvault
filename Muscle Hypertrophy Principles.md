- Just need to hit a certain stimuli needed to induce hypertrophy: large signal, moderate frequency and/or Lower signal, higher frequency
- Many styles of training work
- Need to challenge a muscle to come back bigger, provide the nutrients to allow growth
- Need a strong enough signal one time, has to be frequent enough, or it has to be a combination, to induce muscle protein synthesis 
- Large signal, mod frequency or Lower signal, high frequency 
- E.g. intensity techniques such as blood flow restriction with low weight, taken to fatigue failure will be a larger  metabolic disturbance response, but you will need to do it less frequently. Or high weight 8-10 reps muscle damage via mechanical tension
- Can do multiple different techniques in a single session
-   
    

Exercise choice

- not critical with specificity, need to hit all major and minor muscle groups. Choosing by movement pattern vs specific muscle groups, both work, personal preference
- Bilat and unilateral exercises
- Select exercises that you can lift close to failure without putting you at risk of injury
- Compound, isolation, machines all good
- picking 2-3+ movements per muscle group, consistency > variation

Exercise order

- again can be flexible, can do compound movements first, or start with exercise you’re most interested in and pre-fatigue it with isolation exercises, making sure you pick exercises that are actually hitting the muscle group you want to train

Appropriate volume

- total number of sets per week is most important
- Ideally 15-20 sets per week per muscle group with direct/secondary exercises
- More volume the better - if plateauing can change from high volume to high intensity or increase volume even more with lower rep range
- If not recovering/still sore/performance drops off - likely too much volume
- If not seeing adaptations, then likely volume not enough
- 8-15 rep range
- Close to failure (e.g. within 2 reps of true failure), hit failure every once in a while with safer exercises, use intensity increasing manoeuvres but need to focus on recovery from them
- Rest 30-90 seconds, - can take 3-4 mins but need higher weight or volume, depending on how heavy and intensity of movement, good to mix it up

Training Frequency 

- frequency doesn’t matter so much as long as the total load and intensity are high enough
- However can be good to train 3 days a week full body as insurance/resilient to life
- Or 2 days a week whole body, 2 days a week body part split
- train muscle groups more than once a week ~every 5 days, depends on training intensity/volume

Progressive Overload
