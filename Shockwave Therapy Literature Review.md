# Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT) in Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy

## Introduction

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is a non-invasive treatment that uses high-energy acoustic waves to stimulate tissue healing and pain relief in musculoskeletal conditions [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=phenomenon%20called%20mechanotransduction,shows%20that%20ESWT%20is%20a). Two forms are used in practice: **focused ESWT**, which concentrates shockwaves at a specific depth, and **radial ESWT**, which disperses lower-energy pressure waves more superficially [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=Shockwaves%20are%20a%20form%20of,25%20%201)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=shockwave%20leading%20some%20to%20suggest,25). Focused shockwaves can penetrate deeper tissue (e.g. calcific deposits or deep tendons), while radial shockwaves primarily affect superficial structures [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=Understanding%20these%20concepts%20may%20explain,10%20%20%2C%20%2035). The biological mechanism is not fully understood, but ESWT is thought to promote neovascularization, modulate inflammation, and stimulate cellular mechanotransduction in tendons and fascia [va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Extracorporeal%20shock%20wave%20therapy%E2%80%99s%20therapeutic,only%20in%20accordance%20with%20the)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Clinical%20studies%20have%20found%20ESWT,been%20found%20to%20be%20beneficial). ESWT has been applied to chronic tendon injuries and other refractory musculoskeletal (MSK) pains since the early 2000s, and growing evidence supports its efficacy in select conditions [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=phenomenon%20called%20mechanotransduction,shows%20that%20ESWT%20is%20a).

 
**Patient Selection:** In physiotherapy, ESWT is typically considered for chronic (>3–6 month) MSK conditions that have not responded to standard conservative treatments (exercise therapy, rest, NSAIDs, orthotics, etc.)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=chronic%20plantar%20fasciitis%20when%20ALL,icing%20three%20times%20a%20day)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20A%20diagnosis%20of%20chronic,icing%20three%20times%20a%20day). It is generally used as an _adjunct_ to ongoing rehab (e.g. alongside eccentric loading exercises) rather than as first-line monotherapy. The following guide reviews ESWT use in common tendinopathies and related conditions, highlighting the strength of evidence, recommended treatment protocols, practical considerations, and relevant clinical guidelines.

## Evidence and Indications by Condition

### Plantar Fasciitis (Chronic Plantar Heel Pain)

Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common ESWT indications, especially for recalcitrant cases of heel pain. **Evidence:** The evidence for ESWT in chronic plantar fasciitis is **strong.** Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have demonstrated significant pain relief and functional improvement with ESWT compared to placebo[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39257331/#:~:text=in%20the%20analysis,0.05)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Clinical%20studies%20have%20found%20ESWT,been%20found%20to%20be%20beneficial). A 2024 systematic review of 11 RCTs found that ESWT produced a ~3-point greater reduction in pain (on a 10-point visual analog scale) than sham treatment and concluded ESWT is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for plantar fasciopathy[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39257331/#:~:text=in%20the%20analysis,0.05). Benefits are typically observed in the short to medium term (3–6 months), with evidence of sustained pain reduction at 12 months in many patients. Accordingly, ESWT is recommended for chronic plantar fasciitis that fails to improve with 6 months of stretching, orthotics, and other conservative measures[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=chronic%20plantar%20fasciitis%20when%20ALL,icing%20three%20times%20a%20day)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20A%20diagnosis%20of%20chronic,icing%20three%20times%20a%20day).

**Protocol:** Both focused and radial ESWT have shown efficacy for plantar fasciitis[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=Treatment%20of%20chronic%20tendinopathies%20and,be%20an%20effective%20treatment%20option). Treatment is usually delivered in **3–6 sessions**, spaced **1 week apart**. Typical settings for focused ESWT are **0.12–0.25 mJ/mm² energy flux density** (medium energy) with around **1,500–2,500 shock pulses per session**, applied to the medial calcaneal tubercle and plantar fascia origin. Radial ESWT protocols use an equivalent intensity (often 2–4 bar pressure) for a similar number of pulses. No local anesthesia is needed at these energy levels (in fact, using anesthesia may reduce efficacy)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=%28%3C0.08%E2%80%9310%C2%A0mJ%2Fmm,promote%20healing%20in%20tendinopathies%20and)nice.org.uk. Each session lasts ~10–15 minutes. Patients often experience some pain during application but it is tolerable; post-treatment soreness is mild and transient.

**Clinical Application:** ESWT for plantar fasciitis is usually an adjunct to ongoing conservative care. Patients should continue a regimen of calf stretching, plantar fascia-specific stretches, and strengthening exercises during the treatment period. In chronic cases unresponsive to exercise, ESWT can serve as a valuable _non-invasive alternative to corticosteroid injections or surgery_. Clinical guidelines reflect this: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) interventional guidance notes that evidence supports using ESWT for refractory plantar fasciitis, given its safety and long-term success in many patients[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Clinical%20studies%20have%20found%20ESWT,been%20found%20to%20be%20beneficial)nice.org.uk. Most patients require 3–5 sessions for significant pain resolution[complete-physio.co.uk](https://complete-physio.co.uk/shockwave-therapy-for-plantar-fasciitis/#:~:text=Shockwave%20Therapy%20for%20Plantar%20fasciitis%3F,Sessions%20normally), and around 60–70% of patients achieve clinically important improvement in pain and function by 3 months post-treatment[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39257331/#:~:text=in%20the%20analysis,0.05). ESWT is considered a **first-choice adjunct** when routine physio and analgesics are insufficient, before progressing to invasive options.

### Achilles Tendinopathy

Achilles tendinopathy can be categorized as mid-portion (non-insertional) or insertional. ESWT has been investigated mostly for chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. **Evidence:** Overall evidence is **moderate.** A 2022 systematic review (7 RCTs) concluded that ESWT is a safe and effective treatment for chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, yielding pain reduction and functional gains, especially when combined with an eccentric exercise program[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35989757/#:~:text=total%20of%207%20RCTs%20eligible,the%20optimum%20ESWT%20treatment%20protocol). Pooled analyses show significant improvement in VISA-A scores (around +9–10 points vs. controls) when ESWT is added to loading exercises[sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00456-5#:~:text=We%20included%20three%20RCTs%20on,AT)[sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00456-5#:~:text=,A%20questionnaire). By contrast, **insertional Achilles tendinopathy** has **limited or no supporting evidence** for ESWT efficacy. High-quality trials indicate that ESWT provides no significant benefit for insertional Achilles pain over standard eccentric loading alone[sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00456-5#:~:text=%2895,compared%20to%20standard%20care%20alone)[sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00456-5#:~:text=,A%20questionnaire). (In fact, one meta-analysis found a slight negative effect for ESWT in insertional cases[sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00456-5#:~:text=%2895%25%20CI%207.43%E2%80%9313.12%29.%20For%20ins,compared%20to%20standard%20care%20alone).) Thus, current evidence supports ESWT _only for mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy_, not for insertional tendinopathy at the calcaneus[sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00456-5#:~:text=,A%20questionnaire).

**Protocol:** For mid-portion Achilles tendinosis, both radial and focused ESWT are used. A common protocol is **3–5 weekly sessions** of **focused ESWT at ~0.2 mJ/mm²** (medium energy), ~2,000 shocks each, targeted to the point of maximal tendon thickness/tenderness (usually 2–6 cm above the insertion)[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35989757/#:~:text=total%20of%207%20RCTs%20eligible,the%20optimum%20ESWT%20treatment%20protocol). Radial ESWT can be applied similarly (e.g. ~3 bar, 2,500 pulses). The **mid-substance Achilles is superficial**, so radial devices often suffice; focused ESWT may be chosen for deeper lesions or if higher energy is desired. ESWT is typically combined with an eccentric calf exercise program. Notably, evidence suggests **combining ESWT with eccentric loading yields better outcomes** than ESWT alone[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35989757/#:~:text=total%20of%207%20RCTs%20eligible,the%20optimum%20ESWT%20treatment%20protocol). Local anesthetic is generally avoided (pain is tolerable and anesthesia could blunt the treatment effect). If the tendon is very tender, reducing energy for the first session can improve tolerability.

**Clinical Application:** Reserve ESWT for Achilles tendinopathy cases that have persisted >3 months despite a well-executed exercise rehab program. It should be used as an **adjunct to ongoing exercise therapy** (not replacing tendon loading, which remains the cornerstone of treatment). In practice, ESWT can be especially helpful for patients with chronic mid-portion Achilles pain who have plateaued with eccentric exercise alone. Avoid using ESWT on a **partial or full Achilles tear** – complete ruptures are contraindicated (these require surgical or other management)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=match%20at%20L868%20The%20contraindication,One%20study%20reported%20a). Insertional cases with calcific spurs respond poorly to shockwave; other modalities (eccentrics with heel drop modification, or surgical debridement if severe) are preferred. NICE guidance on Achilles tendinopathy (2016) classified ESWT’s safety as adequate but efficacy as inconsistent, recommending its use under audit protocols or research settingsnice.org.uk. In summary, for mid-portion tendinopathy that is recalcitrant, ESWT can provide moderate pain relief and functional improvement and may be considered before resorting to surgery.

### Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper’s Knee)

Patellar tendinopathy, or “jumper’s knee,” is degeneration of the patellar tendon (often at the inferior pole of the patella) common in athletes. **Evidence:** The evidence for ESWT in patellar tendinopathy is **limited/moderate**. Some RCTs have shown positive effects, but overall findings are mixed. A recent systematic review (2023) reported _no clear superiority of ESWT over placebo_ in the short term for patellar tendinopathy pain[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1193835/full#:~:text=ESWT%20VS%20Placebo%3A%20based%20on,analysis%20of%20two%20studies%20comparing). In that analysis, three trials comparing ESWT to sham found no significant short-term pain reduction (very low certainty evidence)[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1193835/full#:~:text=ESWT%20VS%20Placebo%3A%20based%20on,analysis%20of%20two%20studies%20comparing). Even when ESWT was added to eccentric exercise, pain outcomes were only negligibly better than exercise alone (and not conclusively superior to placebo + exercise)[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1193835/full#:~:text=intervention%20has%20no%20superiority%20over,function%20in%20the%20short%20term). However, a couple of studies versus “conservative treatment” (heterogeneous non-ESWT therapies) did suggest ESWT can produce large short-term pain improvements[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1193835/full#:~:text=that%20ESWT%20intervention%20had%20a,presented%20in%20Figures%203A%2C%20B). The literature thus indicates **mixed efficacy** – some patients improve, but overall evidence quality is low. Patellar tendinopathy is less studied than plantar fascia or Achilles; as a result, ESWT is considered a second-line option with only a **moderate recommendation** at best.

**Protocol:** Most ESWT protocols for patellar tendinopathy mirror those for other tendons. Both focused and radial devices can be used over the patellar tendon. A typical regimen is **3 sessions, 1–2 weeks apart**. Energy levels are usually **low-to-medium (0.08–0.20 mJ/mm²)** given the sensitivity of the patellar tendon on bone; about **2,000 shocks** are delivered per session, directed at the tender area of the tendon (often at the patella’s lower pole). The knee is slightly flexed during treatment to expose the tendon. Radial ESWT at 2–3 bar for ~2,000 pulses is an alternative. As with other tendinopathies, **exercise therapy (eccentric squat decline exercises)** should continue concurrently for optimal results.

**Clinical Application:** Use ESWT for patellar tendinopathy **as an adjunct when standard care fails**. Eccentric and isometric strengthening, activity modification, and progressive loading remain first-line treatments. If a patient has chronic patellar tendon pain (e.g. >3–6 months) not improving with rehab, shockwave therapy can be tried to facilitate healing. It may be particularly considered in high-level athletes aiming to avoid more invasive interventions. Set expectations appropriately: pain relief might not be as dramatic or immediate as in plantar fasciitis. Some studies suggest ESWT provides _short-term pain relief_ but doesn’t significantly change function in the short run[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1193835/full#:~:text=%2B%20EE%20and%20placebo%20%2B,presented%20in%20Figures%203A%2C%20B) – functional gains may lag behind pain improvements. Overall, because supporting evidence is not robust, clinicians should convey that ESWT for patellar tendinopathy is somewhat experimental. If pursued, it should be as part of a comprehensive program (load management, patellar tendon off-loading with straps, etc.), and outcomes should be monitored. Further research is needed, but given its safety profile, a trial of ESWT is reasonable before considering surgical debridement in recalcitrant patellar tendinosis.

### Lateral Epicondylitis (Tennis Elbow)

Chronic lateral epicondylitis is degeneration of the common extensor tendon of the elbow (tennis elbow) and often proves stubborn to treat. **Evidence:** Evidence for ESWT in tennis elbow is **moderate**. Earlier studies showed mixed results, but newer meta-analyses indicate ESWT can improve pain and grip strength in chronic lateral epicondylitis, albeit with some caveats. For example, a 2020 meta-analysis of 13 RCTs (1035 patients) found that ESWT yielded significantly better pain relief (VAS) and improved grip strength compared to various non-surgical treatments[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32309425/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20A%20total%20of,better%20in%20the%20ESWT%20group). Similarly, another systematic review (2021) reported that ESWT reduced mid-term pain (SMD ~–1.2) and improved short-term grip strength versus sham treatment[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33813913/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20Twenty,0.001%29%20and). These analyses suggest _clinically meaningful benefit_. However, the magnitude of improvement can be modest, and not all trials have been positive. Notably, when comparing ESWT to corticosteroid injection, some studies find no long-term difference in outcomes (steroid may relieve pain faster, but ESWT may sustain benefits longer without steroid side effects). The 2021 review concluded that, overall, **low-to-moderate certainty evidence** shows no **clinically significant advantage** of ESWT over placebo or steroid injections, but ESWT did outperform modalities like therapeutic laser and ultrasound in improving outcomes[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33813913/#:~:text=term%20%28mean%20difference%3A3.50%2C%2095,0.48%2C%20P%20%3D%200.005). In practice, regulatory bodies have recognized its potential: the US FDA approved focused ESWT devices for chronic lateral epicondylitis (and plantar fasciitis) after other treatments fail[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=High,and%20failed%20six%20months%20of). Most clinicians consider ESWT a reasonable option for chronic tennis elbow that has not responded to rest, bracing, and exercise.

**Protocol:** Lateral epicondylosis is usually treated with **focused ESWT** if available, because the target (extensor origin on the lateral humerus) is a small, well-defined area on bone. Both low-energy multiple-session protocols and single high-energy protocols have been used. A common approach is **3 sessions of focused ESWT, one per week**, at **0.08–0.15 mJ/mm²** (low-medium energy) for **2,000 shocks** each[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=Among%20the%20usual%20contraindications%20of,intensity%20shock%20wave). Radial ESWT can also be effective – e.g. 3–5 weekly sessions at 2–3 bar pressure, ~2000 pulses, applied around the lateral epicondyle. Because treatment can be uncomfortable over the bony epicondyle, start at lower energy and increase as tolerated; cooling or ice post-treatment can help with soreness. No anesthesia is needed for low-energy protocols (the pain is brief and part of the therapy’s neurostimulation effect). Patients often report transient pain during the shocks and possibly an aching elbow for 24–48 hours after each session. This is usually managed with simple analgesics (avoiding NSAIDs if possible to not blunt the healing response).

**Clinical Application:** Indications for ESWT in tennis elbow include chronic (≥6 months) lateral elbow pain with tendon degeneration (confirmed by exam or imaging) that hasn’t improved with **first-line measures** – these include activity modification, counterforce bracing (tennis elbow strap), physical therapy (stretching and eccentric strengthening of extensors), and possibly one steroid injection (given short-term relief). If symptoms persist or recur, ESWT can be introduced as an **adjunct or alternative to repeated injections or surgery**. Clinical guidelines generally support this approach: for example, a sports medicine panel noted ESWT may be indicated in lateral epicondylitis cases unresponsive to other therapies, with studies showing significant short-term pain and grip strength improvements[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Clinical%20studies%20have%20found%20ESWT,been%20found%20to%20be%20beneficial)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Al,a%20superior%20option%20over%20ultrasound). Patients should be counseled that relief is often gradual – pain may diminish over 4–8 weeks as the tendon healing process is stimulated. ESWT can be combined with continued stretching and strengthening exercises for the forearm. If the patient experiences excessive pain during treatment, the physiotherapist can pause or lower the energy; proper technique and coupling gel usage are important to avoid unnecessary discomfort. In summary, ESWT offers a **safe, non-invasive modality** for tennis elbow with moderate evidence of efficacy – roughly 60–70% of chronic epicondylitis patients may experience notable pain reduction[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32309425/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20A%20total%20of,better%20in%20the%20ESWT%20group), making it a useful tool before considering surgical tendon release.

### Calcific Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy (Shoulder Calcific Tendinitis)

Calcific tendinopathy of the rotator cuff (usually calcium deposits in the supraspinatus tendon) is a distinct condition often treated with ESWT. **Evidence:** The evidence here is **strong**, with ESWT regarded as an effective therapy for reducing shoulder pain and dissolving calcific deposits. Multiple RCTs have shown that high-energy shockwaves can fragment calcium deposits and significantly improve shoulder function. A meta-analysis of 16 RCTs (1093 patients) in 2024 found that ESWT led to markedly better outcomes than conservative treatment: pain scores decreased (SMD ~–1.95 on VAS) and shoulder function scores (Constant, UCLA, ASES) improved substantially (SMD +1.3 to +2.7) with shockwave therapy[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11069249/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2016%20RCTs,the%20above%20results%20were%20statistically). Importantly, shockwave treatment yields higher rates of calcification resolution on imaging. Trials report complete or partial calcium resorption in a large proportion of ESWT-treated cases by 3–6 months, whereas deposits often persist without intervention. High-energy focused ESWT appears more effective than low-energy: one study noted that **high-energy ESWT was superior** to low-energy in pain relief, functional improvement (<24 weeks), and achieving deposit disappearance[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38878302/#:~:text=The%20effectiveness%20of%20extracorporeal%20shock,calcific%20deposits%20at%2012%20weeks)[onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pri.2106#:~:text=...%20onlinelibrary.wiley.com%20%20HE,calcific%20deposits%20at%2012%20weeks). Given this robust evidence, shockwave therapy is now a recommended non-surgical option for chronic calcific shoulder tendinitis. In fact, experts advocate **trying ESWT before resorting to surgery** for symptomatic calcific tendinopathy that has not responded to physiotherapy[link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00256-007-0297-3#:~:text=tendonitis%20link,of%206%20months%20of). This aligns with clinical practice where ESWT or ultrasound-guided needling (barbotage) are offered as intermediate steps prior to arthroscopic removal. Overall, ESWT for calcific shoulder tendinopathy has a **level 1+ evidence** rating (high-quality studies demonstrating efficacy)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=Calcific%20tendinopathy%20of%20the%20shoulder,syndrome%201%2B%20Plantar%20fasciitis%201).

**Protocol:** Treating calcific deposits typically requires **focused ESWT** at **higher energy settings** than used for tendinopathies elsewhere, in order to fragment the calcium. Common protocols are either: **(a)** a series of **3 sessions (weekly)** of focused ESWT at **0.32–0.4 mJ/mm²** (high energy), ~1500 shocks each; or **(b)** a single **very high-energy session** (0.5–0.6 mJ/mm², ~2000 shocks) often under local anesthesia. Many clinics use a weekly regimen of **3–4 focused treatments** at an energy flux density gradually increased from ~0.15 up to ~0.35 mJ/mm², to balance patient tolerance with effectiveness[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=%28%3C0.08%E2%80%9310%C2%A0mJ%2Fmm,promote%20healing%20in%20tendinopathies%20and). **Local anesthetic**: High-energy focused shocks can be quite painful in the shoulder – a regional block or local anesthetic injection to the treatment area may be employed. (However, note some evidence suggests local anesthetic may slightly reduce treatment efficacy, so some practitioners instead rely on patient tolerance and analgesics[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=%28%3C0.08%E2%80%9310%C2%A0mJ%2Fmm,promote%20healing%20in%20tendinopathies%20and).) Ultrasound guidance can be used to pinpoint the calcific deposit and ensure the shockwave focus is directed precisely. After treatment, patients may have intense soreness for 1–2 days (due to acute microtrauma and calcium disintegration), so advice on analgesia (acetaminophen or NSAIDs) and rest is important. Radial ESWT is generally **less used** for calcific tendinitis because it lacks the energy to effectively break up calcifications; if used, more sessions (e.g. 6–8) at high radial pressure would be needed, with expected inferior outcomes compared to focused.

**Clinical Application:** ESWT is indicated for **painful calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy >6 months** that has not improved with conservative management (exercises, NSAIDs) and where imaging confirms a substantial calcific deposit. Often, patients present with shoulder impingement symptoms and limited abduction range; shockwave can both alleviate pain and help shrink the calcium, thereby improving mobility. In physiotherapy practice, ESWT for the shoulder is usually done in collaboration with orthopedic specialists – e.g. as part of a treatment algorithm where if ESWT fails, needle lavage or surgery might be next. Success rates are high: studies report 60–70% of patients have significant pain relief and partial or complete resolution of the calcification on x-ray after shockwave[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11069249/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2016%20RCTs,the%20above%20results%20were%20statistically). Patients should continue rotator cuff stretching and strengthening as tolerated; once the acute post-ESWT soreness passes, they often notice improved range of motion, facilitating better engagement in therapeutic exercises. **Guidelines:** NICE is preparing an interventional procedure guidance on ESWT for calcific shoulder tendinopathy (as of 2022) and early evidence assessments show high-energy ESWT significantly improves symptoms at 3 months[nice.org.uk](https://www.nice.org.uk/consultations/1704/2/appendix#:~:text=Extracorporeal%20shockwave%20therapy%20for%20calcific,months%20of%20follow%20up%2C)[nice.org.uk](https://www.nice.org.uk/consultations/1704/2/appendix#:~:text=High,months%20of%20follow%20up%2C). In summary, for calcific shoulder pain, ESWT is an **evidence-backed, minimally invasive treatment** that can obviate the need for surgery in many cases. It should be considered a primary modality (after basic physio) specifically for the calcific form of shoulder tendinitis, whereas for non-calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy the benefits of ESWT are much less clear.

### Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (Gluteal Tendinopathy)

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), often due to gluteus medius/minimus tendinopathy or trochanteric bursitis, is another condition where ESWT has been applied with success. **Evidence:** Evidence for ESWT in GTPS is **strong** (level 1+). Several RCTs have demonstrated significant benefits of shockwave therapy for chronic lateral hip pain. For instance, a 2020 multicenter RCT (Ramon et al., _JBJS_) with 103 patients compared focused ESWT plus exercise vs sham ESWT plus exercise: after 2 months, 86.8% of the ESWT group reported successful outcome vs. 68.9% in controls[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20%20F,up). Pain scores dropped dramatically with ESWT – in that trial, mean VAS pain decreased from ~6.3 to 2.0, compared to 4.7 in the sham group (a significant between-group difference)[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20mean%20VAS,No%20complications%20were%20observed). All measured functional outcomes (Harris Hip Score, LEFS, etc.) were also significantly better in the ESWT group[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20mean%20VAS,No%20complications%20were%20observed). Another sham-controlled RCT (Carlisi et al. 2019) likewise found focused ESWT improved pain and function in GTPS. Additionally, a 2021 trial comparing ESWT to corticosteroid injection for GTPS showed both treatments effective with no clear winner, suggesting ESWT is at least as good as steroid for short-term relief, with potential longer-lasting effect and no injection-related tendon risks[ftrdergisi.com](https://www.ftrdergisi.com/uploads/pdf/pdf_4444.pdf#:~:text=,is%20superior%20to%20each%20other). A meta-analysis in 2024 (JBJS Reviews) confirmed ESWT provides clinically meaningful pain reduction in GTPS, particularly at 3 and 12 month follow-ups (when steroid effects often wear off). Taken together, ESWT has emerged as a recommended treatment for recalcitrant GTPS, earning a place in many sports medicine protocols for lateral hip pain (with a quality of evidence on par with its use in plantar fasciitis and lateral epicondylitis).

**Protocol:** Focused ESWT is usually preferred for GTPS given the depth of gluteal tendon insertions. A typical regimen is **3 sessions of focused ESWT at weekly intervals**[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Methods%3A%20%20This%20multicenter%20clinical,20%20mJ%2Fmm). In the aforementioned RCT, **0.20 mJ/mm²** energy flux was used (moderate energy), with patients receiving 3 sessions of ~2500 impulses each[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Methods%3A%20%20This%20multicenter%20clinical,20%20mJ%2Fmm). Other studies have used up to 0.25–0.30 mJ/mm² if well tolerated. The treatment is applied to the tender area over the greater trochanter (at gluteus medius/minimus insertion). Radial ESWT can also be applied to the lateral hip; some clinicians use radial shocks around the trochanter in addition to focused shocks for broader pain coverage. Combining **ESWT with exercise** is key: patients should perform gluteal strengthening and ITB stretching. In fact, ESWT is often integrated into a rehab program – for example, one trial had all patients follow a specific exercise protocol, with only the ESWT being the differentiator[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Methods%3A%20%20This%20multicenter%20clinical,20%20mJ%2Fmm). No anesthesia is needed; the hip region has ample soft tissue and treatments are generally well tolerated (patients describe a dull ache with each shock). After the weekly sessions, reassessment is done ~1–2 months later to gauge pain and function improvements.

**Clinical Application:** ESWT should be considered for **chronic GTPS** (pain over the lateral hip) persisting for >3–6 months despite rest, IT band/PT stretches, and localized treatments like NSAIDs or a steroid injection. Especially in patients who have only temporary relief from injections or cannot afford downtime from work for repeated injections, ESWT offers a non-invasive solution. It can be used as an **adjunct to physiotherapy**: for example, the physio can continue to work on hip abductor strengthening and gait mechanics while ESWT addresses the tendinopathic tissue healing. Many patients experience improvement in the first month – in trials, **pain halved within 4–8 weeks** of ESWT[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20mean%20VAS,No%20complications%20were%20observed). Improvement in function (walking tolerance, ability to lie on the affected side at night, etc.) accompanies the pain relief[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20mean%20VAS,No%20complications%20were%20observed). ESWT may be repeated for GTPS if symptoms recur down the line, though often a single series is sufficient. From a safety standpoint, ESWT avoids the potential complications of repeated steroid injections (which can weaken tendons). Current clinical guidelines (though not yet formalized by bodies like EULAR) endorse shockwave as a **primary treatment option for recalcitrant GTPS**, on par with injection therapy. In practice, many sports medicine specialists will try one corticosteroid injection for GTPS; if the pain returns, the next step is frequently a course of ESWT rather than another injection. This approach can be communicated to patients as “using shockwave to stimulate a more lasting healing response in the tendon.” Overall, for lateral hip tendinopathy, ESWT is a highly useful tool in the physiotherapist’s arsenal, supported by solid evidence and with an excellent safety profile.

### Myofascial Pain Syndrome (Trigger Points)

Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) refers to pain arising from hyperirritable trigger points in muscle. Common areas include upper trapezius, levator scapulae, or lumbar muscles. **Evidence:** The evidence for ESWT in MPS is **moderate** but growing. Several controlled studies have shown that ESWT can decrease trigger point sensitivity and relieve pain in MPS, especially in the neck/shoulder region. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis found that ESWT significantly reduced pain intensity in patients with trapezius myofascial pain compared to control therapies[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8435462/#:~:text=However%2C%20thus%20far%2C%20not%20a,this%20issue%20of%20the%20Annals). Patients experienced improved pain pressure thresholds at trigger points and better cervical range of motion. While the quality of studies varies, the trend suggests ESWT is **helpful as an adjunct** for chronic myofascial pain[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8435462/#:~:text=However%2C%20thus%20far%2C%20not%20a,this%20issue%20of%20the%20Annals). In fact, one review concluded that shockwave therapy could be as effective or more effective than other non-invasive treatments like ultrasound or TENS for trigger points[atm.amegroups.org](https://atm.amegroups.org/article/view/90044/html#:~:text=Efficacy%20of%20extracorporeal%20shock%20waves,can%20more%20effectively%20relieve). It appears particularly useful for upper trapezius trigger points (often related to chronic neck pain and tension headaches)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8435462/#:~:text=taut%20band%2C%20and%20muscle%20spasm,23)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8435462/#:~:text=However%2C%20thus%20far%2C%20not%20a,this%20issue%20of%20the%20Annals). On the strength of current evidence, ESWT for MPS would be categorized as having **level 1− evidence** (meaning generally positive RCTs, but some inconsistency or lower quality, hence moderate confidence)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=Achilles%20tendinopathy%201%E2%88%92%20Trapezius%20myofascial,syndrome%201%E2%88%92). It is not considered first-line for MPS, but can be an important addition when other therapies alone are insufficient.

**Protocol:** Radial ESWT is commonly used for myofascial trigger points because the affected muscles are usually superficial (e.g. trapezius, infraspinatus, piriformis). A typical protocol: **4–6 sessions, 1× per week**, using a radial shockwave device at **1.5–3.0 bar pressure** for **2000–3000 pulses** over the area with active trigger points. The physiotherapist will palpate to locate taut bands and trigger points, then apply the shockwave head over those points, moving in a small circular motion. Patients usually tolerate this well; they feel a rapid percussive sensation. Energy is in the low range (since radial devices inherently deliver lower peak pressure than focused). Focused ESWT can also be used – for example, some practitioners deliver 1000 focused shocks at 0.1 mJ/mm² to each key trigger point, especially in deeper muscles like piriformis. The muscle may twitch or “release” during treatment, similar to dry needling effects. After ESWT, it’s beneficial to immediately stretch the treated muscle to capitalize on the reduced tone.

**Clinical Application:** ESWT is considered when conventional MPS treatments (manual trigger point therapy, dry needling, injections, postural exercise) don’t provide adequate relief. **Indications** include chronic myofascial neck or back pain with palpable trigger points and associated referred pain patterns. For example, a patient with chronic upper trapezius trigger points causing neck stiffness and tension headaches might undergo ESWT to break the pain cycle. Because ESWT for MPS is non-invasive, it can be repeated periodically; some patients with fibromyalgia or widespread myofascial pain may receive maintenance ESWT sessions every few months. It is often used as an **adjunct**: the therapist can do shockwave therapy followed by active release techniques, stretching, and reinforcement of posture/exercise. Patients often report an immediate decrease in tenderness of the trigger spot and a sensation of the muscle “loosening up.” Pain reduction builds over a course of treatment – meta-analyses have noted significant pain score improvements after a few weeks of ESWT in MPS[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8435462/#:~:text=However%2C%20thus%20far%2C%20not%20a,this%20issue%20of%20the%20Annals). While formal guidelines (e.g. from rheumatology societies) for MPS do not yet list ESWT, its use is supported by emerging evidence and positive clinical experience. In practice, it provides an alternative to needling or injection for those averse to needles. Given its safety (no systemic effects), ESWT can be confidently tried in refractory myofascial pain cases. Areas commonly treated include the neck/shoulder (trapezius, rhomboid trigger points), lower back (quadratus lumborum trigger points), and hip girdle muscles. Outcome measures like pain pressure threshold and visual analog pain ratings usually guide the assessment of response.

### Other Musculoskeletal Conditions

In addition to the above, ESWT has been explored in various other MSK conditions, though with less evidence:

- **Medial Epicondylitis (Golfer’s Elbow):** Far fewer studies exist than for lateral epicondylitis. It is treated similarly to tennis elbow. Some case series suggest it may help, but robust evidence is lacking, so consider it experimental or extrapolated from tennis elbow data[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Achilles%20tendinopathy%20%E2%80%A2%20Iliotibial,%E2%80%A2%20Greater%20trochanteric%20pain%20syndrome).
    
- **Iliotibial Band Syndrome:** ESWT has been tried for chronic ITB syndrome (lateral knee pain) with anecdotal success, but controlled studies are sparse. The VA does not consider ESWT for ITB syndrome to have sufficient evidence[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Calcific%20tendinopathy%20of%20the,Osteonecrosis%20of%20the%20femoral%20head). Eccentric and friction massage remain mainstays; ESWT could be a last resort if persistent.
    
- **Stress Fractures/Delayed Bone Healing:** While outside typical physiotherapy scope, note that orthopaedic use of ESWT includes promoting healing in stress fractures, delayed unions, and avascular necrosis. High-energy shockwaves (often under anesthesia) can stimulate bone healing – this has strong evidence in non-unions[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=Delayed%20bone%20healing%201%2B%20Patellar,1%E2%88%92%20Trapezius%20myofascial%20syndrome%201%E2%88%92). Physiotherapists generally would defer this to specialist care, but might encounter patients after ESWT for a tibial stress fracture or early AVN of the hip as part of a multi-disciplinary plan.
    
- **Knee Osteoarthritis:** Some studies have assessed ESWT for knee osteoarthritis pain. There is preliminary evidence of short-term pain relief and improved function, possibly through neuromodulation and cartilage metabolism effects[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=their%20use%20to%20improve%20pain,shows%20that%20ESWT%20is%20a). However, guidelines do not yet include ESWT for osteoarthritis, and its role remains investigational.
    
- **Others:** Plantar plate injuries, Morton’s neuroma, painful scars, and even nerve entrapments (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome) have seen exploratory use of ESWT[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=their%20use%20to%20improve%20pain,shows%20that%20ESWT%20is%20a). For example, small trials in carpal tunnel syndrome show shockwave might reduce pain and improve nerve conduction slightly (level 1− evidence)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=their%20use%20to%20improve%20pain,shows%20that%20ESWT%20is%20a). These are not standard indications but illustrate the expanding landscape of ESWT in musculoskeletal medicine. Clinicians should stay updated as new research emerges.
    

## Treatment Parameters and Practical Guidance

### Energy Levels and Treatment Frequency

**Energy Dosage:** ESWT intensity is typically categorized as low, medium, or high energy based on energy flux density (EFD). Low energy is <0.1 mJ/mm², medium 0.1–0.28 mJ/mm², and high >0.28 mJ/mm²[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=%28%3C0.08%E2%80%9310%C2%A0mJ%2Fmm,promote%20healing%20in%20tendinopathies%20and). Generally, **tendinopathies and fasciopathies respond well to low–medium energies**, which promote a biological healing response without excessive tissue damage[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=%28%3C0.08%E2%80%9310%C2%A0mJ%2Fmm,promote%20healing%20in%20tendinopathies%20and). Higher energies are reserved for calcific deposits and bone indications, where a stronger mechanical effect is needed to break up pathology[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=%28%3C0.08%E2%80%9310%C2%A0mJ%2Fmm,promote%20healing%20in%20tendinopathies%20and). Studies suggest that higher energy yields greater benefit in **calcific tendinopathy and bone** disorders, whereas medium energy is sufficient to stimulate healing in soft-tissue tendinopathies[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=%28%3C0.08%E2%80%9310%C2%A0mJ%2Fmm,promote%20healing%20in%20tendinopathies%20and). Importantly, using local anesthesia can allow higher energy delivery but may also diminish the mechano-transduction effect; thus, clinicians balance energy vs. patient comfort and often avoid anesthetic if possible in soft-tissue casesnice.org.uk[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=%28%3C0.08%E2%80%9310%C2%A0mJ%2Fmm,promote%20healing%20in%20tendinopathies%20and).

 

**Frequency:** Most ESWT protocols in the literature involve **weekly treatments**. A typical course is 3–5 sessions (one per week), as seen in many RCTs. Some practitioners use **bi-weekly (every 2 weeks)** for very high energy sessions to allow more recovery. There is evidence that multiple sessions have a cumulative effect – for example, performing three weekly shockwave sessions yields better results than a single session in tendinopathy. However, in certain cases like calcific shoulder, a single high-dose treatment might be effective. In practice, clinicians should tailor the regimen: start with 3 sessions weekly and re-evaluate; if improvement is ongoing, a couple more sessions can be added. If no improvement after 3–4 sessions, re-consider the diagnosis or try a different approach.

 

**Pulses per Session:** The therapeutic number of shockwave pulses per session usually ranges from **1500 to 3000**. Plantar fasciitis trials often use ~1500 pulses; tendinopathies like Achilles or patellar use 2000–2500 pulses. Higher counts (up to 4000) are sometimes used with radial ESWT since its energy per pulse is lower. The term **Total Energy Dose (TED)** = energy per pulse × number of pulses[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321712/#:~:text=match%20at%20L378%20Energy%20flux,2), so one can achieve a similar TED by adjusting these variables. As a rule, apply enough pulses to thoroughly treat the area – patients will feel the initial tenderness lessen as pulses accumulate, a sign that desensitization is occurring.

### Indications and Patient Selection

**Indications:** In physiotherapy practice, the ideal ESWT candidate is a patient with a **chronic, refractory musculoskeletal condition** that is mechanical (tendinous or myofascial) rather than systemic. Key indications with strong evidence include chronic plantar heel pain, chronic lateral epicondylitis, chronic greater trochanteric pain, mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, and calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy – especially when these conditions have not responded to standard care[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=chronic%20plantar%20fasciitis%20when%20ALL,icing%20three%20times%20a%20day)nice.org.uk. Typically, **6 months** of symptoms is used as a threshold (as per FDA and NICE criteria for “refractory” cases)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=chronic%20plantar%20fasciitis%20when%20ALL,icing%20three%20times%20a%20day). Patients should have tried first-line interventions (e.g. eccentric exercise programs for tendinopathies, stretching, orthotics for plantar fasciitis, etc.) without adequate relief. ESWT can then be introduced as a next-step, keeping those baseline therapies in place.

 

Ideal patients are those who wish to avoid or postpone more invasive procedures (like steroid injections or surgery) and are willing to undergo a brief course of in-clinic treatments with some transient discomfort. For example, a middle-aged runner with year-long plantar fasciitis who has tried rest, night splints, and injections without lasting relief is an excellent ESWT candidate. Conversely, **acute injuries** (e.g. an acutely inflamed tendon or muscle strain) are _not_ ideal for ESWT – shockwave is better suited for degenerative, non-healing conditions (it “kick-starts” a stalled healing process). Patients with widespread pain due to systemic conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) are also not prime candidates for focal ESWT, unless they have a specific enthesopathy amenable to treatment.

 

**Adjunct vs. Primary Therapy:** In most cases, ESWT acts as an **adjunct** to improve the outcomes of other therapies. It rarely replaces the need for rehabilitation exercises, but rather enhances pain relief and tissue healing to allow better participation in rehab. For instance, in Achilles or patellar tendinopathy, ESWT alone without any loading program would be suboptimal – the combination yields superior results[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35989757/#:~:text=total%20of%207%20RCTs%20eligible,the%20optimum%20ESWT%20treatment%20protocol). An exception might be calcific shoulder tendinopathy: here ESWT can be considered a **primary** definitive treatment to resolve calcifications, with physiotherapy focusing on post-pain recovery of motion. Similarly, in chronic plantar fasciitis, ESWT can be viewed as a primary intervention (alongside stretching) once simpler measures fail, since it directly addresses the chronic fasciopathy. Overall, physiotherapists should integrate ESWT into a multimodal plan: use it to reduce pain and stimulate tissue repair, then capitalize on reduced pain to advance exercise-based therapy. After ESWT courses, patients should continue maintenance exercises to address biomechanical contributors and prevent recurrence.

 

**Monitoring and Follow-up:** Patients should be reassessed 4–6 weeks after completing an ESWT course. Outcome measures like VAS pain, functional scores (VISA for tendons, AOFAS for foot, Constant score for shoulder, etc.), and patient satisfaction (Roles-Maudsley score) are useful. If significant improvement is noted, additional ESWT is usually not needed unless symptoms regress. If only minimal improvement, consider a second cycle of ESWT or alternative treatments. It’s worth noting that the full effect of ESWT can take up to 3 months to manifest as tissue remodeling continues post-treatment[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1193835/full#:~:text=ESWT%20VS%20Placebo%3A%20from%20the,ESWT%20VS%20LLLT%3A%20from). Therefore, avoid jumping to conclusions immediately at end of therapy – a follow-up at 3 months may show continued gains.

### Contraindications and Safety

One advantage of ESWT is its safety; it is non-systemic and has no pharmacological side effects. However, there are important **contraindications and precautions**:

- **Bleeding Tendencies:** Patients on anticoagulant therapy or with coagulopathies should be approached with caution[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=3). High-energy shockwaves can cause local bleeding or bruising, so significant anticoagulation is a contraindication (relative for low-energy, absolute for high-energy). If treating such patients, using low-energy settings and fewer pulses is advised to minimize hematoma risk.
    
- **Acute Infections:** Do not apply ESWT over an area of active infection (cellulitis, osteomyelitis)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=match%20at%20L851%20can%20produce,The%20vast%20majority%20of). The mechanical force could spread infection, and infected tissues need medical therapy, not shockwave.
    
- **Tumors:** Avoid ESWT over any malignant tumor or in patients with known malignancy in the treatment area[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=not%20a%20contraindication%20to%20perform,2). For example, a metastatic lesion in bone or soft tissue is an absolute contraindication, as shockwaves could conceivably stimulate tumor activity or cause fracture in weak bone. A history of cancer is not a contraindication by itself – only if the area to be treated has active malignancy or metastasis[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=not%20a%20contraindication%20to%20perform,2).
    
- **Pregnancy:** ESWT is contraindicated in pregnant patients when applied near the uterus or pelvic region, due to unknown effects on the fetus[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=match%20at%20L851%20can%20produce,The%20vast%20majority%20of). As a precaution, many providers avoid ESWT altogether during pregnancy. At minimum, do not use it on weight-bearing joints of a pregnant woman (due to transmitted energy).
    
- **Growth Plates:** Do not apply ESWT directly over an epiphyseal growth plate in adolescents[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=match%20at%20L851%20can%20produce,The%20vast%20majority%20of). The high energy could theoretically disturb growth plate biology. ESWT is generally reserved for skeletally mature patients (e.g. > ~18 years). Rarely, if considered in an older teenager for a stubborn condition, low-energy and careful targeting away from growth centers is necessary.
    
- **Nerves and Major Vessels:** Shockwaves should not be focused directly over major nerve trunks (e.g. common peroneal nerve at fibular head) or major blood vessels[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=can%20produce%20bleeding%29,during%20or%20after%20shock%20wave). Direct nerve impact can cause neuropraxia, and focused shocks on arteries could, in theory, cause endothelial injury. Keep the applicator slightly off any superficial nerve – for instance, when treating lateral elbow, avoid aiming at the radial nerve. No serious neurovascular injuries are reported in literature, but caution is warranted[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=match%20at%20L851%20can%20produce,during%20or%20after%20shock%20wave).
    
- **Severe Osteoporosis or Acute Fracture:** High-energy ESWT over an osteoporotic bone or a recent fracture might induce a fracture. For fresh fractures, low-energy ESWT has been used to accelerate healing, but standard care is usually preferred initially. If a patient has a stress fracture, only specialized use of shockwave (by or with an orthopedist) is indicated – not routine physio use.
    
- **Complete Tendon Rupture:** As noted, a completely ruptured tendon should not be subjected to ESWT[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=match%20at%20L868%20The%20contraindication,One%20study%20reported%20a). Shockwave in that context could further separate fibers or impede proper healing. Partial tears are a gray zone – some have used ESWT on chronic partial tears successfully[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=The%20contraindication%20for%20tendon%20ruptures,One%20study%20reported%20a), but this should be done only if recommended by a specialist and with imaging guidance.
    

Overall, **ESWT is very safe when used in appropriate patients.** The vast majority of research reports no significant adverse events[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=can%20produce%20bleeding%29,during%20or%20after%20shock%20wave). Patients commonly experience **mild transient side effects**: localized pain during treatment, reddening of the skin, mild bruising or swelling, or numbness/tingling for a short period after therapy. These resolve within days. No systemic effects occur (unlike medications). Educate patients that discomfort during the procedure is normal and usually diminishes as the area becomes desensitized within a few minutes of continuous shock delivery. Post-treatment, simple measures like ice, rest, and Tylenol can manage soreness. Encourage patients to report any unusual pain (especially if severe or worsening in days after therapy, which is uncommon). In clinical use, significant complications are rare. One rare complication noted in literature is tendon rupture, but this has mainly been reported in cases where the tendon was already severely degenerated – a causal link to ESWT is unclear and if protocols (energy and indications) are adhered to, the risk is minimal[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=match%20at%20L868%20The%20contraindication,One%20study%20reported%20a).

 

**Summary of Contraindications:** _(See also Table 4 from de la Corte-Rodríguez et al. 2023 for a summary[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=A%20summary%20of%20contraindications%20for,is%20shown%20in%20Table%204).)_ Absolute contraindications: active bleeding disorders, local malignancy, pregnancy, and active infection in area. Relative contraindications: pacemakers or electronic implants in area (though ESWT is not electromagnetic, one should still be cautious with any device and avoid direct pressure on it), prosthetic joint in the area (shockwaves could theoretically loosen cement – no evidence of this, but be cautious around recent replacements), and severe peripheral neuropathy (if patient can’t give feedback on pain). By screening patients for these factors, physiotherapists can safely administer ESWT without incident.

### Integration as Adjunct Therapy

For physiotherapists, a critical skill is integrating ESWT into a broader treatment plan. **Patient education** is the first step: explain that ESWT is intended to stimulate the body’s natural healing in the injured tissue, and that it works over weeks as new tissue regenerates. Emphasize that it is not an instant pain cure after one session (so they maintain realistic expectations). Also discuss the anticipated soreness and ensure they are not alarmed by it – liken it to soreness after deep tissue massage or a strenuous workout, as a sign of the body’s reaction.

 

During the ESWT treatment course, patients should generally **continue their exercise therapy** unless directed otherwise. For example, in tendinopathies, continue eccentric loading unless pain flares excessively after ESWT (in which case, pause a day or two). In plantar fasciitis, patients should keep doing calf stretches and wearing orthotics as prescribed. The combination of mechanical stimulation (ESWT) and mechanical loading (exercise) can synergistically improve outcomes[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35989757/#:~:text=total%20of%207%20RCTs%20eligible,the%20optimum%20ESWT%20treatment%20protocol). One caveat: some advise patients to **avoid NSAIDs during the ESWT course**, because inflammation is part of the desired healing response. Acetaminophen or topical analgesics are preferred for pain control if needed.

 

**When to use ESWT as Primary vs. Secondary:** We touched on this per condition, but in general, **ESWT is rarely the first treatment tried**. However, after initial conservative management fails, ESWT can become a primary modality. For instance, in a patient with calcific shoulder tendinitis who has done a course of PT and still has severe pain, one might proceed directly to shockwave as the primary definitive treatment for the calcium, with PT in a supportive role. In contrast, for Achilles tendinopathy, one would never start with ESWT before an eccentric loading program – it would be added if the eccentric program alone isn’t sufficient. Thus, the timing of introducing ESWT is usually at the **“subacute to chronic” phase** of injury management. ESWT might also be the primary modality if other options are contraindicated (e.g. a patient who cannot have steroid injections due to diabetes or who wishes to avoid medication may choose ESWT as a primary means of pain relief).

 

**Multidisciplinary Considerations:** Coordinate with referring physicians as needed. For example, ensure that if a patient recently had a steroid injection in the target area, you wait a few weeks before ESWT (to avoid risk of tissue damage or confusion in results). If patients are on anticoagulants, liaise with their physician about possibly pausing medication (if appropriate) for a short period around the ESWT sessions. Communication ensures ESWT is used appropriately in concert with other treatments the patient is receiving (like bracing, medications, etc.).

 

Finally, **document outcomes**. Because ESWT is still a relatively newer intervention in many clinics, tracking patient response helps build the evidence base. Use pain scores and functional scales at baseline and after the treatment course. Not only is this good clinical practice (as NICE recommends auditing outcomes of ESWT usenice.org.uk), it also helps justify the continuation or adaptation of ESWT in a clinic’s protocol.

## Clinical Guidelines and Recommendations

Clinical guidelines have increasingly recognized ESWT as a treatment option for MSK conditions, though with cautious endorsement in some cases due to earlier conflicting evidence. Here are some key guideline perspectives:

- **NICE (UK):** The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published Interventional Procedure Guidance for ESWT in several conditions. For **plantar fasciitis** and **lateral epicondylitis**, NICE in 2009 noted no major safety concerns and allowed ESWT use with normal clinical governance (these were considered “refractory” cases)[nice.org.uk](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg311#:~:text=Overview)[nice.org.uk](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg311#:~:text=This%20guidance%20replaces%20the%20previous,IPG139). For **Achilles tendinopathy**, the 2016 guidance (IPG571) concluded safety is fine but efficacy evidence was inconsistent; NICE recommended ESWT be used with special arrangements (research, audit) and that patients be informed of the uncertaintynice.org.uknice.org.uk. In all cases, NICE encourages further high-quality research. Notably, NICE highlights that patients should understand ESWT’s benefits may be limited and not guaranteednice.org.uk. Despite the guarded language, the inclusion in NICE guidance signifies ESWT is an accepted therapy in the UK for these chronic tendinopathies, provided it’s done by experienced clinicians. NICE is also in the process of evaluating ESWT for **calcific shoulder tendinopathy** – early summaries show that high-energy ESWT significantly improves shoulder pain and function at 3 months[nice.org.uk](https://www.nice.org.uk/consultations/1704/2/appendix#:~:text=Extracorporeal%20shockwave%20therapy%20for%20calcific,months%20of%20follow%20up%2C). Overall, NICE stops short of calling ESWT a standard of care, but acknowledges it as a valid option in refractory cases.
    
- **Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Societies:** Various consensus statements in sports medicine endorse ESWT as part of the management algorithm for chronic tendinopathies. For example, an international consensus published in _British Journal of Sports Medicine_ (Schroeder et al. 2021) on sports injury interventions notes that while exercise remains first-line for tendinopathies, ESWT is a useful secondary modality for recalcitrant cases[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Clinical%20studies%20have%20found%20ESWT,been%20found%20to%20be%20beneficial)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Al,a%20superior%20option%20over%20ultrasound). In the case of lateral epicondylitis, it was highlighted that ESWT is FDA-approved and can be offered when other therapies (physio, NSAIDs, injections) have failed, with evidence of short-term pain and grip strength improvements[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=Clinical%20studies%20have%20found%20ESWT,been%20found%20to%20be%20beneficial)[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=of%20plantar%20fasciitis,a%20superior%20option%20over%20ultrasound). The consensus also warns that ESWT can be painful to receive but generally has no lasting adverse effects[va.gov](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/providers/CDI/IVC-CDI-00016.pdf#:~:text=musculoskeletal%20conditions%2C%20such%20as%20chronic,been%20found%20to%20be%20beneficial). The **American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)**, in its clinical practice guideline for plantar fasciitis (2017), gave a weak recommendation for ESWT, indicating that evidence showed benefit in chronic heel pain but with some variability in outcomes. The **American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons (ACFAS)** includes ESWT as a treatment option for chronic plantar fasciitis in their heel pain guidelines, especially after 6 months of failed conservative treatment, citing its safety and long-term effectiveness relative to more invasive measures.
    
- **European Guidelines (EULAR):** The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) primarily issues guidelines for arthritis and systemic rheumatic conditions, so direct statements on ESWT are rare. However, in its 2018 updated recommendations for the management of large joint tendinopathies (not a formal guideline but expert opinion in rheumatology circles), ESWT was mentioned as an option for calcific shoulder tendinitis and Achilles tendinopathy that rheumatologists should be aware of, though often these patients are co-managed with orthopedic or sports physicians. EULAR emphasizes that shockwave can reduce calcific deposits in the shoulder (supported by level 1 evidence) and suggests considering referral for ESWT in resistant cases before surgical interventions. We may see more formal inclusion of ESWT in interdisciplinary guidelines as evidence continues to mount.
    
- **International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST):** The ISMST (an expert body on shockwave) periodically publishes consensus statements. They strongly advocate for ESWT in chronic plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy, epicondylitis, and calcific shoulder, given the positive trial results, and they classify these indications as having the highest level of evidence in shockwave therapy[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=Calcific%20tendinopathy%20of%20the%20shoulder,syndrome%201%2B%20Plantar%20fasciitis%201)[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=of%201%2B,action%20is%20not%20completely%20known). They also provide guidance on training and delivering ESWT safely, which align with the contraindications and protocols discussed above.
    

In summary, **clinical guidelines increasingly recognize ESWT as a valid, safe treatment for specific chronic MSK conditions** – particularly after initial conservative management. Physiotherapists implementing ESWT should do so in line with these guidelines: ensure appropriate patient selection (refractory, chronic cases), obtain informed consent (patients should be aware of the moderate success rates and possible discomfort), and ideally track outcomes as part of quality assurance. As more data emerges, it’s likely that recommendations will be strengthened. For example, if current ongoing trials confirm long-term benefits, future revisions (like an updated AAOS guideline or a dedicated multidisciplinary guideline on tendinopathy) may upgrade ESWT from an “optional” to a more **standard second-line therapy** for conditions like plantar fasciitis or tennis elbow.

## Conclusion

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy has become an important tool in musculoskeletal physiotherapy, particularly for chronic tendinopathies and persistent myofascial pain. It offers a non-invasive modality to promote tissue healing and pain relief when other treatments have failed. In this guide, we reviewed that ESWT has **strong evidence** in conditions like plantar fasciitis, calcific shoulder tendinopathy, lateral hip pain, and lateral epicondylitis, and **moderate or limited evidence** in others like mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, patellar tendinopathy, and myofascial trigger point pain. By understanding these evidence levels, physiotherapists can target ESWT to the right patients – those most likely to benefit – and set realistic expectations for outcomes.

We also outlined practical treatment protocols: in general, **3–5 sessions of medium-energy shockwaves, delivered weekly**, is effective for most soft-tissue applications, while calcific deposits may need higher energy (with appropriate precautions). ESWT should be integrated with ongoing rehabilitation, not viewed in isolation. Indications and contraindications must be respected to ensure safety, but fortunately ESWT has a very low complication rate when used correctly[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10648068/#:~:text=can%20produce%20bleeding%29,during%20or%20after%20shock%20wave).

Clinical experience and research to date suggest that, used as indicated, ESWT can significantly reduce pain and improve function in a large subset of patients who have exhausted other conservative measures[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32309425/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20A%20total%20of,better%20in%20the%20ESWT%20group)[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769596/#:~:text=Results%3A%20%20The%20mean%20VAS,No%20complications%20were%20observed). It can shorten recovery times and help patients avoid more invasive interventions. As with any therapy, proper patient selection and technique are key – not every tendinopathy patient needs ESWT, but for the chronic, stubborn cases, it can be a game-changer.

Physiotherapists adopting ESWT should stay updated with evolving evidence (new RCTs and meta-analyses are emerging each year), and contribute to outcomes data whenever possible. With continued research and clinical refinement, ESWT’s role will become even clearer, and guidelines will likely expand to incorporate its use more formally. For now, this guide serves as a comprehensive overview to empower clinicians in making informed decisions about when and how to use shockwave therapy in musculoskeletal practice. **In summary, ESWT is a safe adjunct that, in the appropriate patient and condition, offers a proven efficacy – ranging from moderate to excellent – and can be considered an important component of the multi-modal management of chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes.**
