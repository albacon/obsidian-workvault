## Differentiation Algorithm

1. **Local neck pain aggravated by movement/palpation?**  
   ‚Üí Likely **Muscular** or **Facet Joint** origin.

2. **Scapular or shoulder ache with no neuro symptoms?**  
   ‚Üí Think **Somatic Referred Pain**.

3. **Symptoms worse with shoulder motion, not neck?**  
   ‚Üí Suggests **Shoulder Pathology**.

4. **Unilateral headache triggered by neck movement/posture?**  
   ‚Üí Consider **Cervicogenic Headache**.

5. **Morning stiffness, older age, worse in extension/rotation?**  
   ‚Üí Suggests **Cervical OA**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Management Tips

- Educate and offload compression sites (e.g. elbow pads, wrist support)
- Ergonomic adjustments (keyboard, work height, etc.)
- Nerve gliding/mobilisation exercises
- Strengthen surrounding musculature without provoking nerve
- Refer for nerve conduction studies if uncertain or persistent
- Escalate to GP or specialist if symptoms worsen or show motor loss

## Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)

Involves compression of the **neurovascular structures** as they pass through the thoracic outlet (between neck and arm). 
Notoriously difficult to diagnose, more rare than we think.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Types of TOS
- **Neurogenic (most common 90-95%)** ‚Äì brachial plexus compression
- **Vascular (rare)** ‚Äì subclavian artery or vein compression

# Red Flag Pathologies
## [[Cervical Artery Dysfunction]]

## Serious Headaches

In MSK physio, the most relevant types of headaches to screen for are:
- **Cervicogenic Headache**
- **Red Flag Headache** (e.g. SAH, tumour, vascular)

---

### üß© Cervicogenic Headache

A **somatic referred pain** from the **upper cervical spine (C1‚ÄìC3)** structures.
#### üîç Key Features:
- Unilateral headache, usually starting in the neck
- Triggered by neck movements or sustained posture (e.g. desk work)
- Pain may radiate to occiput, eye, forehead, or temple
- Associated stiffness or dysfunction in C1‚ÄìC3

#### üß™ Aggravated By:
- Cervical rotation
- Retraction/protraction
- Sustained positions
- Palpation of upper cervical joints and muscles (e.g. suboccipitals, levator scapulae)

#### üß™ Useful Tests:
| Test Name                         | Positive Sign                                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Flexion-Rotation Test (FRT)**  | Reproduces headache on affected side              |
| **Upper Cervical Palpation**     | Tenderness over C1‚ÄìC3                              |
| **Cranio-cervical flexion/extension tests** | Pain or symptom reproduction during test       |

### SNOOP ‚Äì Red Flag Features for Headaches

Use the **SNOOP** acronym to screen for potentially serious or secondary headache causes (e.g. brain tumour, subarachnoid haemorrhage, infection).

### üß™ Diagnosis & Referral

- ESR/CRP usually **elevated**
- Rapid response to **low-dose corticosteroids**
- Refer to **GP/rheumatology** for investigation and management


## Cervical Spine Instability

Occurs when there is a loss of ligamentous or bony integrity in the **upper cervical spine**, especially around **C1‚ÄìC2**, leading to excessive movement and potential spinal cord compromise.
