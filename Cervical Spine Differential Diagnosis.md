## Differentiation Algorithm

1. **Local neck pain aggravated by movement/palpation?**  
   → Likely **Muscular** or **Facet Joint** origin.

2. **Scapular or shoulder ache with no neuro symptoms?**  
   → Think **Somatic Referred Pain**.

3. **Symptoms worse with shoulder motion, not neck?**  
   → Suggests **Shoulder Pathology**.

4. **Unilateral headache triggered by neck movement/posture?**  
   → Consider **Cervicogenic Headache**.

5. **Morning stiffness, older age, worse in extension/rotation?**  
   → Suggests **Cervical OA**.





# Neuro Pathologies

## [[Cervical Artery Dysfunction]]

## [[Cervical Radiculopathy & Myelopathy]]

## Upper Motor Neuron Lesion (UMNL)

These are **central nervous system pathologies** that may mimic or overlap with cervical spine symptoms.

### 🚩 Key Pathologies
- **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
- **Motor Neurone Disease (MND)**
- **Brain Tumour**
- Other central causes (stroke, trauma, infection)

## Peripheral Nerve Entrapments

Peripheral neuropathies are **nerve entrapments outside the spine**, often mistaken for radiculopathy or TOS.

### 🛠️ Management Tips

- Educate and offload compression sites (e.g. elbow pads, wrist support)
- Ergonomic adjustments (keyboard, work height, etc.)
- Nerve gliding/mobilisation exercises
- Strengthen surrounding musculature without provoking nerve
- Refer for nerve conduction studies if uncertain or persistent
- Escalate to GP or specialist if symptoms worsen or show motor loss

## Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)

Involves compression of the **neurovascular structures** as they pass through the thoracic outlet (between neck and arm). 
Notoriously difficult to diagnose, more rare than we think.

### ⚠️ Types of TOS
- **Neurogenic (most common 90-95%)** – brachial plexus compression
- **Vascular (rare)** – subclavian artery or vein compression

# Red Flag Pathologies
## [[Cervical Artery Dysfunction]]

## Serious Headaches

In MSK physio, the most relevant types of headaches to screen for are:
- **Cervicogenic Headache**
- **Red Flag Headache** (e.g. SAH, tumour, vascular)

---

### 🧩 Cervicogenic Headache

A **somatic referred pain** from the **upper cervical spine (C1–C3)** structures.
#### 🔍 Key Features:
- Unilateral headache, usually starting in the neck
- Triggered by neck movements or sustained posture (e.g. desk work)
- Pain may radiate to occiput, eye, forehead, or temple
- Associated stiffness or dysfunction in C1–C3

#### 🧪 Aggravated By:
- Cervical rotation
- Retraction/protraction
- Sustained positions
- Palpation of upper cervical joints and muscles (e.g. suboccipitals, levator scapulae)

#### 🧪 Useful Tests:
| Test Name                         | Positive Sign                                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Flexion-Rotation Test (FRT)**  | Reproduces headache on affected side              |
| **Upper Cervical Palpation**     | Tenderness over C1–C3                              |
| **Cranio-cervical flexion/extension tests** | Pain or symptom reproduction during test       |

### SNOOP – Red Flag Features for Headaches

Use the **SNOOP** acronym to screen for potentially serious or secondary headache causes (e.g. brain tumour, subarachnoid haemorrhage, infection).

- ESR/CRP usually **elevated**
- Rapid response to **low-dose corticosteroids**
- Refer to **GP/rheumatology** for investigation and management


## Cervical Spine Instability

Occurs when there is a loss of ligamentous or bony integrity in the **upper cervical spine**, especially around **C1–C2**, leading to excessive movement and potential spinal cord compromise.

### 🧠 Clinical Decision-Making

- High suspicion → **Urgent referral for imaging**
- Avoid manual therapy or traction if instability suspected
- Consider underlying **rheumatology referral** if due to inflammatory cause

| :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Muscular                           | 🧘‍♂️ **Education**: Reassure it's a minor strain; keep moving.                                                                      |
|                                       | 📏 **Posture**: Ergonomic advice, avoid prolonged slouched sitting.                                                                  |
|                                       | 🏃 **Exercise**: Cervical AROM (e.g. chin tucks, gentle rotations), scapular retraction, upper traps stretch.                        |
|                                       | 💆 **Manual**: Trigger point release or soft tissue massage if irritable.                                                            |

|                                       | 📐 **Posture**: Avoid sustained extension (e.g. screen too high).                                                                    |
|                                       | 🔁 **Exercise**: Cervical mobility drills (e.g. flexion/rotation), ‘snag’ mobilisations if trained.                                  |
|                                       | 🤲 **Manual**: Gentle PA mobilisations (Grade I-II) if acute.                                                                        |
| 3. Somatic Referred Pain              | 🧠 **Education**: Explain referred pain is from joint/disc but not nerve-related.                                                    |
|                                       | 🚶 **Posture**: Encourage varied movement, avoid static thoracic flexion.                                                            |
