# Triage Process

This course provides an overview of potential causes of lower back pain (LBP) and how to categorise it through subjective and objective assessments. Use the mindset of exclusion — rule out red flags and neuro symptoms before diagnosing NSLBP.

1. Non-specific low back pain 🟢 (90%) - diagnosis by exclusion of the other two

2. LBP with significant neurological deficits ⚡️ (5-10%)
	1. Disc Prolapse
	2. Lateral canal stenosis
	3. Central stenosis
	4. High grade spondylolisthesis

3. Serious or systemic pathology 🚨 (1-2%)
	1. Malignancy
	2. Systemic Inflammatory Disorders
	3. Infections
	4. Fractures

The assessment helps place LBP into one of these categories or identify alternative causes.

# Subjective Assessment

• Key point: 80% of the diagnosis comes from subjective assessment.
- questions to triage into either Serious/Systemic, Neuro, NSLBP

• Important considerations in patient history:
	• Age-related changes:
	• Arthritis and degenerative conditions are common in older adults.
	• Under 20 years old or over 55 → raises suspicion for sinister pathology.

• Inflammatory conditions:
	• More common in the 20–40 age group (e.g., inflammatory arthropathies, rheumatological conditions).

• History of back pain:
	• Helps determine if the condition is recurrent or persistent.

## History of Present Condition

Usual stuff of 🔎
- Location of Pain, When did it start, How it began (trauma vs gradual, ?lifestyle/changes), Course (?deteriorating), Previous Episodes, Previous Interventions & Investigations
- co-related pain?, ?also leg pain, ?started around the same time, ?Neuro symptoms
## Present Condition

- Location, ?any referral ↘️, 
- ?Neuro Signs ⚡️ - Paraesthesia, Weakness
- Aggs & Eases 🔥❄️
	- Mechanical vs Non-Mechanical
	- Movement Pattern: Flexion vs Extension?
	- What affects which symptoms - ?Leg Pain affected by Aggs, ?Neuro Symptoms
	Establishing if mechanical vs non-mechanical and whether the aggs/eases also affect leg pain is very important
	
- 24 Hour Pattern 🕰️
	- ?linked to a certain activity at a specific time of day
		- e.g. Driving, At Work, In Evening after long day, Cooking Dinner
	- Early Morning Stiffness 🌅
		- e.g. OA < 30 mins
		- e.g. AxSpa > 45 mins
	- Night Pain 🌙
		- Inflammatory Pathology (e.g. AxSpa, RA, PMR) 🔥
			- Worse in second half of the night
			- Combine with EMS > 45 mins
		- Cancer 
			- Especially lying flat on back - have to sleep in a chair
			- Night Sweats
			- Attending A+E in the middle of the night

## Drug History & Other Red Flags

• Asking about medications can reveal underlying health issues:
• Example: Warfarin use → Ask why the patient takes it (clotting disorders, cardiovascular conditions).
• Some medications can predispose patients to fractures or interact with pain perception

# ⚡️ Neurogenic Pain:
## Radicular Pain

⬆️ Gain in Nerve Function caused by pathology at the Nerve Root/Spinal Nerve
- Sharp, Shooting, Burning, Lancinating Pain
- Commonly caused by Disc Herniation, Facet Joint Irritation, Degenerative Changes (Spondylosis)
	- could also be cuaed by Serious Pathology e.g. Tumour
- Can expect Positive Neurodynamic Tests

- #### Diagnosis: Stynes Criteria

![[Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 14.36.47.png|550]]

## Radiculopathy

⬇️ Loss of Nerve Function caused by pathology at the Nerve Root/Spinal Nerve
- more likely to have changes in Myotomes, Dermatomes and Reflexes
- may not have positive Neurodynamic Tests

Patients can have both Radicular Pain AND Radiculopathy at the same time

## Spinal Stenosis

**Lumbar spinal stenosis** is a degenerative condition where the **spinal canal, lateral recess, or intervertebral foramina** in the **lower back** become narrowed, leading to **compression of neurovascular structures

It typically presents in **older adults** with **bilateral leg symptoms** (pain, cramping, weakness) that are **worsened by standing or walking** and **relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion** (e.g. leaning on a shopping trolley). This is known as **neurogenic claudication**.

Unlike cauda equina syndrome or myelopathy, it does **not** affect the spinal cord and is **not an emergency**, but should be monitored for **progressive neurological symptoms**.

- #### Causes

👴🏼 Age-Related Changes associated with degenerative changes in the Lumbar Spine
- Thickening of the ligamentum flavum
- Bulging Intervertebral Disc
- Intervertebral Foraminal Narrowing 

Most common in older adults >65 years

Narrowing and Crowding of Spinal Canal/Lateral Recess/Foraminal Recess
	-> Compression of Neurovascular Structures 
		-> Reduced Nerve Conduction/Neurogenic Claudication
			-> Bilateral Leg Symptoms

- #### Signs and Symptoms
	- 🪑 Leg symptoms are often mechanical, and get worse with positional changes, with an absence of red flags. If red flags occur then it is likely progressing to CES.
	- No clear dermatomal pattern like radicular pain
	- 🧍🏻‍♂️Extension narrows the spinal canal and formamina, worsening nerve compression

	In the treadmill test, if the leg symptoms improve on the bike then it is most likely to be Spinal Stenosis Neurogenic Claudication, if both the bike and treadmill cause worsening leg symptoms then it is most likely due to a Vascular Claudication Pathology (Peripheral Artery Disease).

## Non- Spinal causes of LL Neurological Symptoms

### Deep Gluteal Syndrome (Piriformis Syndrome)

Deep Gluteal Syndrome refers to **non-discogenic compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve** in the deep gluteal space — previously often mislabelled as "piriformis syndrome."

> It’s not just the piriformis — multiple structures in the deep gluteal region can be involved (e.g. gemelli, obturator internus, hamstrings, vascular structures).

It is only present in 0.3-6% of sciatic presentations - it is *rare

You have to rule out spinal causes first

##### Diagnostic criteria:

| **Criterion**                              | Summary                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🍑 **Buttock pain**                        | Deep, aching pain localised to the buttock region                   |
| 🚫 **No clear spinal aggravating factors** | Pain is not clearly linked to lumbar flexion/extension              |
| 🪑 **Worse with prolonged sitting**        | Pain increases with long periods of sitting                         |
| 📍 **Tenderness on deep palpation**        | Pain is reproduced when pressing over the sciatic notch/glutes      |
| 🔄 **Reproduced with hip tests**           | Pain triggered by hip stretching or resisted movements (e.g. FADIR) |

Most patients with lumbar radiculopathy also have gluteal trigger points so this is not enough to diagnose DGS




### Peripheral Nerve Lesions

Lower limb nerve symptoms could be due to an issue with one of the lower limb nerves in the periphery.

E.g. 
##### 🧠 Common Peripheral Nerve Lesions – Lower Limb

| Nerve                                 | Site / Cause                                       | Symptoms                                                   | Test / Clues                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 🦶 Tibial Nerve                       | Tarsal Tunnel (medial ankle)                       | Burning, tingling in **sole of foot**, worse with standing | Tinel’s over tarsal tunnel              |
| 🦵 Common Peroneal Nerve              | Fibular head (compression, trauma, surgery)        | Foot drop, numbness on **dorsum of foot** & lateral shin   | Tinel’s over fibular head               |
| 🦿 Deep Peroneal Nerve                | Anterior ankle / tight boots                       | Numbness between **1st and 2nd toe**                       | Weak toe extension                      |
| 🥿 Superficial Peroneal Nerve         | Lateral leg trauma or overuse                      | Numbness over **lateral lower leg** and dorsum of foot     | Stretching may reproduce symptoms       |
| 🧍‍♂️ Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve | Under inguinal ligament (*meralgia paraesthetica*) | Burning/numbness over **outer thigh**, worse with standing | Tight waistband or belts history        |
| 🪑 Sciatic Nerve                      | Deep gluteal compression                           | Buttock pain ± posterior thigh, worse with sitting         | Rule out spine first → DGS if confirmed |

##### Differentiation from Radiculopathy:

| **Feature**            | **Peripheral Nerve Lesion**         | **Radiculopathy**                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Distribution        | Specific **nerve territory**        | Follows **dermatomal** pattern      |
| 📉 Reflex changes      | Rare                                | Common (e.g. ↓ ankle/knee reflexes) |
| 🔬 Neurodynamic tests  | Often negative                      | Often **positive**                  |
| 🧠 Spine movement link | Not typically affected by spine ROM | Symptoms often linked to lumbar ROM |



### UMN Lesion

An upper motor neuron lesion is a neurological pathology affecting the brain and/or spinal cord such as MS, a Brain Tumour, or Spinal Cord Compression

Potential symptoms include:
- 🚶🏻‍♂️ Gait Disturbance or LL Weakness
- 🔀 Loss of Co-ordination
- 🔨 Hyperreflexia or Hyporeflexia (bilateral)
- Loss of selective motor control

You can use Tests such as 
- Babinski
- Clonus
- Hoffman's
to screen for an UMN Lesion

An example of an UMN Lesion is DCM:

### Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM)

[[Cervical Radiculopathy & Myelopathy]]

Would have the symptoms of a Cervical Myelopathy in the UL but also can present with issues in the legs such as:
- Bilateral leg weakness, stiffness, heaviness, imbalance
- Unsteady, clumsy, wide-based Gait

There would be UMN signs
- Hyperreflexia, Babinski, Clonus, +ve Hoffman's

But there may be LMN signs (Hyporeflexia) *at the level of compression
- because the anterior horn cell within the cord and/or nerve roots can be compressed at this level as well

### Medical Causes of LL Neurological Symptoms 🩺

| **Cause**              | **Description**                                                                                       | **Clues**                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🩸 Diabetic Neuropathy** | Long-standing or poorly controlled diabetes → affects **feet**, especially in distal pattern         | Burning, numbness, tingling in feet; stocking-glove pattern; non-mechanical symptoms         |
| **🧬 B12 Deficiency**       | Can cause **strange paraesthesia** in lower limb not matching dermatomes; difficult to diagnose     | Unclear pattern, ask about diet or screen via bloods; symptoms not positionally provoked     |
| **❤️ Vascular (PADS)**     | Peripheral Artery Disease; symptoms worsen with **exertion**, not position                            | Poor cardiovascular history; pain/cramping on walking (not affected by lumbar movements)     |
💡 **Note:** These causes tend to produce **non-mechanical symptoms** and often affect the **distal/peripheral limbs** rather than the proximal leg. Symptoms usually don’t change with spinal movement or lumbar posture.

# 😣 Non-Specific Low Back Pain

Need to assess if the simple low back pain is coming from the back or not

Common Mechanical Conditions to Rule Out:
- Hip Joint (incl. Hip OA)
- GTPS 
- Sacro-Iliac Joint (SIJ)

## Hip Joint (incl. OA)

|**Feature**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|📍 **Location of Pain**|Groin pain or “C-shape” hand over anterior hip|
|⚠️ **Aggs**|Pain worsened by: putting on shoes/socks, getting in/out of car, twisting|
|🚶 **Gait Changes**|**Limping** or stiffness with walking|
|⏰ **EMS < 30 mins**|Early Morning Stiffness suggests **OA** rather than inflammatory cause|
Tests to Rule Out/In Hip as the Source:

| **Test**                       | **What it Assesses**                              | **Positive Finding**                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧍‍♂️ **FABER's Test**         | Flexion, ABduction, External Rotation of hip      | Groin or lateral hip pain = suggests intra-articular issue |
| 💥 **FADDIR Test**             | Flexion, ADduction, Internal Rotation of hip      | Pain = possible femoroacetabular impingement or OA         |
| 🔁 **Prone Internal Rotation** | Passive internal rotation range in prone position | Pain or stiffness = restricted hip joint mobility          |

## GTPS

So if all of these are ruled out and someone has Simple Low Back Pain, what next?
# Assessing Non-Specific Low Back Pain

There are 'textbook signs' that may lead towards certain structures being the source of pain e.g.:

- Pain on Flexion, eased by Lumbar Extension = Potential Disc Problem 💿
- Pain on Lumbar Extension, eased when they bend forwards = Potential Facet Joint Problem 
- 75 year old with worsening symptoms into extension that ease when in flexion = Spinal OA

However we cannot reliably identify which structure is the source of mechanical low back pain

Therefore it is suggested that we         ***Assess for Impairments***, instead of a diagnosis

- e.g. do they have a flexion based problem or an extension based problem
- do they have a movement or control impairment

#### 🧪 Assessment Flow for Non-Specific Low Back Pain

| **Step**                       | **What to Look For**                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Observation**             | Watch *how* they move<br>- Movement quality: slow, stiff, guarded<br>- Do they avoid flexion or extension?<br>- Squatting/picking up objects                                                                                              |
| 🔁 **Active Range of Motion**  | - Flexion, extension, side flexion, repeated movements<br>-- What increases or decreases symptoms?<br>-- Does one direction feel limited or guarded?<br>- Do any movements bring on Neurological symptoms?                                |
| 💪 **Resisted Tests**          | Used to provoke symptoms and assess motor control<br>- Hip extension (often reproduces extension-based pain)<br>- Hip abduction (tests control and lateral stability)<br>- Side flexion control (checks for assymmetry or trunk weakness) |
| ✨ **Functional/Special Tests** | Depending on the patient's activities<br>- Sit-to-stand, single-leg tasks, dynamic control<br>- Consider Balance, coordination, movement quality not just pain provocation                                                                |

| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ↩️ **Flexion pain pattern**      | Pain with bending, sitting, lifting; often prefers extension-based positions                   |
| ↪️ **Extension pain pattern**    | Pain with standing, walking, lying prone; often prefers flexion or sitting                     |
| 🔁 **Hip hinging issues**        | Overuses lumbar spine for bending; poor glute/posterior chain engagement (bends with the back) |
| ⚖️ **Unilateral pelvic control** | Trunk shift, asymmetry, poor lateral control on single-leg tasks                               |
| 😬 **Fear of movement**          | Guarded, stiff, overly cautious behaviour; may catastrophise or avoid movement                 |
#### 🎯 Management Strategies for Different Impairments

| **Identified Impairment**       | **Suggested Management Strategy**                                            |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ↩️ **Flexion pain pattern**      | Teach posterior chain loading (e.g. hip hinging), reduce lumbar flexion loads |
| ↪️ **Extension pain pattern**    | Mobilise hips, strengthen anterior core, offload lumbar extension             |
| 🔁 **Hip hinging issues**        | Movement retraining: deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, glute bridges, hip thrusts |
| ⚖️ **Unilateral pelvic control** | Strengthen lateral hip/trunk (e.g. side planks, step-downs, single-leg tasks)  |
| 😬 **Fear of movement**          | Graded exposure, reassurance, pain education, confidence-building exercises     |
