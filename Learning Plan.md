## What do you need?
You want to visualise all of the connections between each piece and recall the information. It’s kind of building a second brain of information that you can go back to and learn from. It’s to try and learn and understand things deeply. 

  

- define what you would like to know
- create a framework for learning, documenting (making notes), organising and recalling information - build a ‘second brain’ of sorts
- Choose the best and most accessible resources to learn from
- Be consistent, dedicated, diligent in you mission to learn

  

What do I need to know?

- Anatomy (bones, anatomical surfaces, muscles - their attachments and actions, tendons,other soft tissues - ligaments, bursae, menisci, discs etc, nerves - their roots, course and innervation)
- Physiology (of certain tendons, muscles, etc)
- Pathology (all the pathologies for each joint - aetiology, signs and symptoms, pathological process, assessment techniques, special tests, treatment approaches, prognosis)
- Assessment Techniques (assessment approaches for each joint, subjective questioning for special pathologies - red flags, RA, OA etc - objective testing, special tests, outcome measures, objective measures)
- Treatment approaches (rehab principles, advice and education for different pathologies, manual techniques, adjuncts - taping, orthotics etc)

  

You don’t have to do things systematically, in fact learning in pieces as you go will help with interconnectivity with learning. Pick the most pertinent conditions/subjects, slot it into the learning framework, learn and document, keeping it filed/organised and presented in a way that keeps it in context with everything else.

  

My first thought is a ?mind map. ?does the software exist

  

A good example would be PFPS. How are you going to consolidate all of this into a way that is manageable to learn, document, and recall, but keeping it within the context of everything else you would like to learn.

  

All of the above 5 categories are distinct in themselves but have crossover between them, how can you demonstrate that? ?Notion second brain

## To learn list

PFPS - pathology, assessment and management

All anatomy - bones, ligaments, muscles, nerves, misc soft tissue
