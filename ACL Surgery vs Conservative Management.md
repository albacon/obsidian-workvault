## ACL Surgery vs Conservative Management

Landmark Studies

Kanon 2010, Compare trial 2021

One isn’t better than other

- Depends on patient

Does delaying surgery have detrimental outcomes?

- Not necessarily, no evidence showing increased incidence of later knee OA
- Return to higher level sport is the main reason for early surgery 
- If also has gross meniscus injury with constant catching/locking/giving way then needs surgery
- Posterior horn of medial meniscus also provides posterior stability preventing AP translation of tibia
- RTS, Work needs, Knee Health, Age, Finances, Social Interactions, Time all play a part

In most cases:

- give 3-6 months of conservative management
- Driven but outcome measures
- Phase 1: get knee happy again

- Reduce swelling
- Full extension 
- Get quads firing

- Static quads/IRQ/SLR/mini squats

- High volume low intensity
- 20 reps 5 times a day e.g

- Phase 2: Strength and Neuromuscular Control

- regain most of muscle strength
- regain most single leg balance 
- Single Leg squad good technique and alignment
- Quad/Ham strength ?equal ratio
- Lateral hip and calf strength

- Hip thrust, banded walks
- Straight/bent knee raises

- Squats are very good - build efficient squat pattern
- Quads are King in ACL rehab
- Leg press/RDL more hamstrings
- Split squat/lunges more quads
- Lateral movements e.g lunges
- Single leg squat test RT running
- Can move onto open chain, especially in conservative as not worried about laxity - can be more aggressive

- Leg extension v good

- Phase 3: Running, Agility, Landing

- Good hop performance (technique, distance, endurance) good knee strategy
- Plyometric - 
- Agility and RTS Program

- Phase 4: RTS


Melbourne ACL Testing protocol

- decide when to move to next phase
