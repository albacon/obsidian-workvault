## Assessing Non-Specific Low Back Pain

There are 'textbook signs' that may lead towards certain structures being the source of pain e.g.:

- Pain on Flexion, eased by Lumbar Extension = Potential Disc Problem 💿
- Pain on Lumbar Extension, eased when they bend forwards = Potential Facet Joint Problem 
- 75 year old with worsening symptoms into extension that ease when in flexion = Spinal OA

However we cannot reliably identify which structure is the source of mechanical low back pain

Therefore it is suggested that we  ***Assess for Impairments***, instead of a diagnosis

- e.g. do they have a flexion based problem or an extension based problem
- do they have a movement or control impairment

## 🧪 Assessment Flow for Non-Specific Low Back Pain

| **Step**                       | **What to Look For**                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Observation**             | Watch *how* they move<br>- Movement quality: slow, stiff, guarded<br>- Do they avoid flexion or extension?<br>- Squatting/picking up objects                                                                                              |
| 🔁 **Active Range of Motion**  | - Flexion, extension, side flexion, repeated movements<br>-- What increases or decreases symptoms?<br>-- Does one direction feel limited or guarded?<br>- Do any movements bring on Neurological symptoms?                                |
| 💪 **Resisted Tests**          | Used to provoke symptoms and assess motor control<br>- Hip extension (often reproduces extension-based pain)<br>- Hip abduction (tests control and lateral stability)<br>- Side flexion control (checks for assymmetry or trunk weakness) |
| ✨ **Functional/Special Tests** | Depending on the patient's activities<br>- Sit-to-stand, single-leg tasks, dynamic control<br>- Consider Balance, coordination, movement quality not just pain provocation                                                                |
## 🔍 Common Impairment Patterns to Identify

| **Impairment**                   | **Clues & Clinical Relevance**                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ↩️ **Flexion pain pattern**      | Pain with bending, sitting, lifting; often prefers extension-based positions                   |
| ↪️ **Extension pain pattern**    | Pain with standing, walking, lying prone; often prefers flexion or sitting                     |
| 🔁 **Hip hinging issues**        | Overuses lumbar spine for bending; poor glute/posterior chain engagement (bends with the back) |
| ⚖️ **Unilateral pelvic control** | Trunk shift, asymmetry, poor lateral control on single-leg tasks                               |
| 😬 **Fear of movement**          | Guarded, stiff, overly cautious behaviour; may catastrophise or avoid movement                 |
## 🎯 Management Strategies for Different Impairments

| **Identified Impairment**       | **Suggested Management Strategy**                                            |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ↩️ **Flexion pain pattern**      | Teach posterior chain loading (e.g. hip hinging), reduce lumbar flexion loads |
| ↪️ **Extension pain pattern**    | Mobilise hips, strengthen anterior core, offload lumbar extension             |
| 🔁 **Hip hinging issues**        | Movement retraining: deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, glute bridges, hip thrusts |
| ⚖️ **Unilateral pelvic control** | Strengthen lateral hip/trunk (e.g. side planks, step-downs, single-leg tasks)  |
| 😬 **Fear of movement**          | Graded exposure, reassurance, pain education, confidence-building exercises     |
