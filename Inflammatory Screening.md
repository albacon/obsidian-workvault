## ✅ **Definition**

**Inflammatory pathologies** are conditions in which the body’s **immune system triggers ongoing inflammation**, often inappropriately or excessively, leading to **pain, stiffness, swelling, and tissue damage**.

In an MSK context, they primarily affect:

- **Joints**
- **Tendons**
- **Ligaments**
- **Entheses** (where tendons/ligaments attach to bone)
- Sometimes **systemic tissues** (e.g., eyes, gut, skin)

Unlike **mechanical pain**, which arises from load, posture, or trauma, **inflammatory pain** often:

- Comes on **insidiously**
- Is worse **at rest, in the second half of the night or in the morning**
- **Improves with activity**
- Is associated with **systemic features**

## 🔬 **Pathophysiology of Inflammatory Conditions**

### ✅ 1. **Immune System Activation**

In most **inflammatory MSK conditions**, the immune system becomes **abnormally activated** and starts to **attack the body’s own tissues**, especially:

- **Synovium** (joint lining)
- **Entheses** (tendon/ligament insertions)
- **Cartilage, bone, tendons**
- Other organs (skin, eyes, bowel, etc.)

This leads to:

- **Chronic inflammation**
- **Tissue breakdown**
- **Pain, swelling, stiffness, and progressive joint damage**

### **Chronic Inflammatory Response**

1. **Trigger** (genetic predisposition + environmental factor, e.g. infection, stress, microbiome)
    
2. **Immune cell infiltration** into joints or entheses
    
3. **Cytokine storm** – release of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6)
    
4. **Synovial hyperplasia**, cartilage breakdown, bone erosion
    
5. **Fibrosis and joint deformity** over time

## 🧬 Common Examples

- **Axial Spondyloarthropathy (AxSpA)** (Ankylosing Spondylitis)

- **Rheumatoid Arthritis**
    
- **Psoriatic Arthritis**
    
- **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**

## 🤝 **Is it the Same as Rheumatological Conditions?**

### 🧬 Not exactly, but closely related.

- **Rheumatological conditions** are a **subset** of inflammatory pathologies, specifically those that affect the **joints, muscles, and connective tissues**, and are often **autoimmune** in nature.





## What are the key features how do we screen for them?
