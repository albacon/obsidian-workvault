# Cervical Myelopathy

Compression of the spinal cord in the cervical spine.
All nerve roots are affected, also potentially segments below this if serious enough.

## Causes of Compression

- Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (Osteophytes) - Most common
- Central Disc Herniation
- Congenital Central Stenosis
- Mass e.g. Tumour
- Fracture/Instability
- Infection

## Possible Symptoms

- Bilateral (often arms and legs)
	- Arm/Leg Pain (vague or absent)
	- Motor Loss (often diffuse)
	- Sensory changes
- Hyperreflexia
- Clumsy hands, dropping objects, buttoning, handwriting, dexterity
- Lhermitte's Sign (electric shock with neck flexion)

- Gait disturbance/Balance problems
- Bladder/Bowel changes (late)

- Increased tone/spasticity
- UMN signs - Babinski sign, Hoffmann's reflex, Clonus
- +ve Rhomberg (proprioception) - posterior column dysfunction

# Cervical Radiculopathy

Compression or irritation of either, or both, of the dorsal (sensory) and/or ventral (motor) roots of a cervical nerve at one of more vertebral levels.

## Possible Symptoms

- (Mostly) Unilateral
	- Neck, shoulder, arm pain
	- Sensation Loss (If sensory (dorsal nerve root))
	- Motor Weakness/Wasting (If motor(ventral nerve root))
	- Diminished Reflexes (as part of the reflex arc)
	
- Often worsens with neck extension, rotation towards the affected side

## Possible Causes

- Disc Herniation
- Degenerative changes (Spondylosis) - Osteophyte Formation
- Facet Joint Irritation
- Mass affecting exiting foramen of the nerve root

### Cook's Cluster for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM)
3+ = high likelihood of DCM

|Feature|✅ Present?|

|🔁 Positive **Inverted Supinator** sign||
# Triage & Initial Management of Radiculopathy and Myelopathy

![[Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 19.43.31.png]]
- If there are red flags then you need to escalate - either back to the GP or through discussion with senior/ESP
- A&E referral very rare and only if red flags/neuro e.g. deteriorating by the hour

Need to re-check each session

The main thing is to check if symptoms are getting worse, and if they are, the rate at which they are deteriorating. To help inform the decision making above.
